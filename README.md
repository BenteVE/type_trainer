# Type trainer

A program that provides two exercises to help you become a faster at typing:

1. Quicktype: a character or word appears on the screen, the user should type it as fast as possible, the test ends when a time limit is reached
2. Copy: the user copies a text on the screen, when a mistake is made, the user must restart the word from the beginning, the test ends when the whole text is copied

Note: This program is only intended to train the user to type faster and more accurate, it doesn't help the user learn the correct ways to hit the keys.

## Custom tests

Each exercise is associated with a folder with files.
After selecting the exercise, the user can select a file within the associated folder.
This file contains the characters, words or text that will appear in the exercise.
The program comes with a few default tests, but the user can also add their own tests to each exercise by adding files to the corresponding folder.

## Statistics

The program also records your statistics for each file at the bottom of that file.
For the first exercise, the program records the amount of correct words within the time limit.
For the second exercise, the program records the the amount of mistakes and the total time.
